## Topic

The question is often asked, "Why can't we cure cancer?" One reason is that there isn't just "one" cancer. There are more than 200 types of cancer and treatment for one type might not work for another. 

The purpose of this project is to analysis the potential risk factors for cancer through analyizing the data of cancer death rate from each state in Unite States (2007-2013), in order to gain insights into how different demographic groups may be affected by cancer, which can help identify populations that are particularly vulnerable or may require targeted interventions. 

## Main Research Questions
 1. Are there significant differences in total cancer rates among states?
 2. How do cancer rates differ between males and females, and across different age groups?
 3. Are there variations in cancer rates based on different racial or ethnic groups?
 4. Which states have the highest and lowest rates of breast, colorectal, and lung cancer?
 5. Are there any correlations between the rates of different types of cancer?
 6. Are race and ethnicity risk factors for cancer?
