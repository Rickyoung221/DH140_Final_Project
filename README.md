[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Rickyoung221/DH140_Final_Project/main)

## Topic

This project aims to investigate potential factors that affect the cancer death rate. Based on the baseline datasets found, the project would mainly take the state which has the highest cancer mortality as the main comparison sample, focusing on the field of education, air quality, and population distribution to investigate their correlation to the cancer death rate.

## Main Research Questions

- Which types of cancer have the highest death rates overall, and how does the rate vary by state?
- Are there any correlations between cancer death rates and other factors, such as educational level? Any others?
- Any measures that can reduce the cancer death rate?
