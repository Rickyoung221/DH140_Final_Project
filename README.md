## Introduction

This project aims to investigate potential factors that affect the cancer death rate. Based on the baseline datasets found, the project would mainly take the state which has the highest cancer mortality as the main comparison sample, focusing on the field of education, air quality, and population distribution to investigate their correlation to the cancer death rate.



## Data Description and Source

| Cancer Death Rate in Each State (2007-2013)               | The baseline dataset for this project. Information about the rates of cancer deaths in each state is reported. The data shows the total rate as well as rates based on sex, age, and race. Rates are also shown for three specific kinds of cancer: breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer. The data is collected from 2007-2013. | [CORGIS CANCER](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/cancer/) |
| Highest Education Level Rate By State (2008-2012)        | Proportion of Educational attainment for adults age 25 and older for the U.S., States, and counties. ERS compiles the latest statistics on these measures. | [USDA, Economic Research Service using data from U.S. Department of Commerce](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/) |
| Air Quality Index Data Annual by Country (2007-2013)      | Data comes from EPA’s Air Quality System (AQS). It collects daily data and shows the annual statistics for AQI (max, number of values in each category, etc.) by CBSA (metro area) or county. | [EPA - United States Environmental Protection Agency](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Annual) |
| Demographics include population breakdowns by age in U.S. | Population and demographic data on are based on analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS), 1-Year Estimates. | [KFF - The independent source for health policy research, polling, and news.](https://www.kff.org/state-category/demographics-and-the-economy/population/) |

## Motivations: 

Cancer, is a main health problem for us to care about. By examining cancer mortality based on sex, age, and race, we can gain insights into how different demographic groups may be affected by cancer and the possible risk factors. This can help identify populations that are particularly vulnerable or may require targeted interventions. To understand the risk factors, we may help those people who we care about to avoid cancer. 

## Main Research Questions

- Which types of cancer have the highest death rates overall, and how does the rate vary by state?
- Are there any correlations between cancer death rates and other factors, such as educational level? Any others?
- Any measures that can reduce the cancer death rate?
